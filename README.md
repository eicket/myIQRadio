# myIQRadio

Experimental Software Defined Radio (SDR) taking the IQ samples from an audio in device (in stereo) and plays back the decoded audio (in mono) on the audio out device.
When using with a Flex Radio, setup a single DAX IQ Channel in the SmartSDR DAX Control Panel, and select this IQ channel as input to this app.

This is a pure Java implementation, and can easily be rebuilt in any regular Java development environment.

Some interesting features :

- Selectable sample rates from 24000 to 192000 samples / sec
- Decodes USB, LSB, AM and FM
- Variable 100 .. 10000 Hz filter width
- Variable spectrum smoothing
- VFO control to a Flex Radio via TCP/IP

## Some implementation details 

All audio processing and demodulation takes place in the time domain following a well known diagram :

The IQ samples first go through a low pass filter with a variable filter width, after which they are decimated by 4 (in the case of an input sampling rate of 48000 samples/sec).
The low pass filtering and decimation is done with a polyphase filter bank with as many parallel FIR filters as the decimation rate.
The sampling rate after the decimation process is always 12000 samples/sec, independent of the input sampling rate.

The I signal is then delayed by ((Hilbert Transform taps - 1) / 2) samples to maintain a synchronized signal flow with the Q signal going through the Hilbert Transform.
For USB, I minus Q produces the demodulated audio.
For LSB, this is I plus Q.
For AM and FM, the signals are calculated directly after the decimation.

The incoming IQ samples also go through a Fast Fourier Transform with a FFT size of 4096.
A further decimation of 8, produces a 512 point spectrum graph and waterfall.
The line spectrum graph can finally be smoothed by accumulating up to 20 spectral lines, before being displayed on the line chart.

## Filter display utility 

A filter display utility is also available to display filter coefficients and the resulting frequency response.

Different types of parameters (filter cutoff, number of taps, rolloff - alpha value) can be selected for a number of filters (FIR filter, band pass filter, Hilbert transform, ...).


## Java environment

This java application runs on all recent Java versions and was tested on Java 1.8, 15 and 17.

The app uses the native javax library for all audio processing. So no external libraries, dll's .. are required.

The user interface is developed with JavaFX version 15. The GUI layout is defined in the Main.fxml file and can be edited by hand, or better, with the JavaFX SceneBuilder.

In your IDE, make sure that the following jar files are on the project classpath :  
javafx-swt.jar  
javafx.base.jar  
javafx.controls.jar  
javafx.fxml.jar  
javafx.graphics.jar  
javafx.media.jar  
javafx.swing.jar  
javafx.web.jar  

The Java app can be started up as follows :
java --module-path "{your path to Java FX}\openjfx-15.0.1_windows-x64_bin-sdk\javafx-sdk-15.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -Djava.util.logging.config.file=console_logging.properties -jar "dist\myIQRadio.jar"


Give it a try, and if you like it, give it a good fork !
